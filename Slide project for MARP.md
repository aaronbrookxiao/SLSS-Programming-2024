# Where?

The Tesla Robot will be for sale between 2025-2027 
but I am predicting that it will be sold on their website 
as people will buy cars from Tesla but not really a robot
so it probrably won't be sold at your nearby Tesla cardealer,
The main headquarters are located in Austin, Texas United states.
