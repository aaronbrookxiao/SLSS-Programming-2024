to make a list we use the following:

* This is the first item in the list
* This is the second
  * This is actually a subpoint in this list

- This is also a list
- You can use these as bullets as well
    - You can also use sublists with dashes

1. This is the first item in an ordered list
3. This is the second, I put 3 but it renders as 2 cuz its smart
    1. this is a sublst
    2. another item
        - This is unordered
        - Same here

# Blockquote 

These are usually used to show quotes, things people have said
